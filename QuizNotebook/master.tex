\subsection{Question 4}
Suppose you have a dataset with m = 1000000 examples and n=200000
features for each example. You want to use multivariate linear regression to
fit the parameters $\theta$ to our data. Should you prefer gradient descent or the
normal equation?



1. 
Suppose m=4 students have taken some class, and the class had a midterm exam and a final exam. You have collected a dataset of their scores on the two exams, which is as follows:

midterm exam	(midterm exam)2	final exam
89	7921	96
72	5184	74
94	8836	87
69	4761	78
You'd like to use polynomial regression to predict a student's final exam score from their midterm exam score. Concretely, suppose you want to fit a model of the form hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2, where x1 is the midterm score and x2 is (midterm score)2. Further, you plan to use both feature scaling (dividing by the "max-min", or range, of a feature) and mean normalization.

What is the normalized feature x(1)1? (Hint: midterm = 89, final = 96 is training example 1.) Please round off your answer to two decimal places and enter in the text box below.

2. 
You run gradient descent for 15 iterations

with α=0.3 and compute

J(θ) after each iteration. You find that the

value of J(θ) \textbfdecreases} quickly then levels

off. Based on this, which of the following conclusions seems most plausible?



α=0.3 is an effective choice of learning rate.  [YES]

Rather than use the current value of α, it'd be more promising to try a smaller value of α (say α=0.1).

Rather than use the current value of α, it'd be more promising to try a larger value of α (say α=1.0).

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
3. 
Suppose you have m=23 training examples with n=5 features (excluding the additional all-ones feature for the intercept term, which you should add). The normal equation is θ=(XTX)−1XTy. For the given values of m and n, what are the dimensions of θ, X, and y in this equation?

\begin{itemize}
\item X is 23×6, y is 23×1, θ is 6×1 [YES]

\item X is 23×5, y is 23×1, θ is 5×5

\itemX is 23×5, y is 23×1, θ is 5×1

\item X is 23×6, y is 23×6, θ is 6×6
\end{itemize}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
4. 
Suppose you have a dataset with m=1000000 examples and n=200000 features for each example. You want to use multivariate linear regression to fit the parameters θ to our data. Should you prefer gradient descent or the normal equation?


\begin{itemize}
\item The normal equation, since it provides an efficient way to directly find the solution. [NO]

\item Gradient descent, since it will always converge to the optimal θ.

\item Gradient descent, since (XTX)−1 will be very slow to compute in the normal equation.

\item The normal equation, since gradient descent might be unable to find the optimal θ.
\end{itemize}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{ Question 5.} 
Which of the following are reasons for using feature scaling?

\begin{itemize}
\item It speeds up solving for θ using the normal equation.
\item It prevents the matrix $X^TX$ (used in the normal equation) from being non-invertable (singular/degenerate).
\item It speeds up gradient descent by making it require fewer iterations to get to a good solution.
\item It is necessary to prevent gradient descent from getting stuck in local optima.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item If one neural network overfits the training set, one reasonable step is to
increase the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
\item For computational efficiency, after we performed gradient checking to verify that our back-propagation 
code is correct, we usually disable gradient checkking before using back-propagation to train

You run $k-$means with 50 random initializations and obtain 50 different clusterings solution of the data.
What is the recommended way of choosing which solution to use.

\subsection{The Distortion Function}
For each of the clustering solutions, the distortion function is computed as 
\[ \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m}_{i=1} \parallel x^{(i)} - \mu_c^{(i)}\parallel ^2 \]
The optimal clustering solution is the solution that minizes the distortion function.
Since a lower value for a distortion function, implies a better clustering, you should choose the clustering with 
smallest value of the distortion function.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Finding Closest Centroids}

In the cluste assignment phase of the algorithm, the algorithm assigns every training example $x^{(n)}$ to the closest 
centroid, given the current position of the centroids.

\[ C^{(i)} := J \mbox{ that minimizes } \| x^{} - \mu_j \| ^2 \]

\begin{itemize}
\item $C^{(i)}$ index of the centroid clostest to $x^{(i)}$
\item $\mu_j$ is the position of the $j-$th centroid.
\end{itemize}

%---------------%
\subsection{Computing Centroid Means}

\[ 
\mu_k := \frac{1}{abs(C_k)} \sum_{i \in C_k} x^{(i)}
\]
%---------------%

A good way to initialize k-mean is to select $k$ distinct examples from the training set and set the cluster centroids equal to these selected examples.

On every iteration of $k-$means, the cost function $J(C^{(1)},C^{(2)},\ldots, C^{(n)},
\mu_1,\ldots \mu_k)$

The distortion function should either stay the same or decrease, in particular it should not increase.

\subsection{Recommended Applications of PCA}

\item Data Compression: reducing the dimensionof input data $x^{(i)}$, which will be used in a supervised learning algorithm

\begin{itemize}
\item Choose the value of k that minimizes the approximation error 1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||2.

\item Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 1\% of the variance is retained.

\item Choose k to be 99\% of n (i.e., k=0.99∗n, rounded to the nearest integer).

\item Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 99% of the variance is retained. [CORRECT - Selected]

1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||21m∑mi=1||x(i)||2≥0.05

%====================================================================%
\subsection{ Question 4. }
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item Given an input x $in$ $\mathbb{R}^n$, PCA compresses it to a lower-dimensional vector z$in$ $\mathbb{R}^k$.

\item PCA can be used only to reduce the dimensionality of data by 1 (such as 3D to 2D, or 2D to 1D).

\item If the input features are on very different scales, it is a good idea to perform feature scaling before applying PCA.

\item Feature scaling is not useful for PCA, since the eigenvector calculation (such as using Octave's svd(Sigma) routine) takes care of this automatically.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Question 5. }
Which of the following are recommended applications of PCA? Select all that apply.

\begin{itemize}

\item [CORRECT] Data compression: Reduce the dimension of your input data x(i), which will be used in a supervised learning algorithm (i.e., use PCA so that your supervised learning algorithm runs faster).

\item As a replacement for (or alternative to) linear regression: For most learning applications, PCA and linear regression give substantially similar results.
