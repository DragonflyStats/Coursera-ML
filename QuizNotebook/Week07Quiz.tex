\section{Week 7 Unsupervised Learning}
\subsection{K-means Clustering}


\begin{itemize}
	\item In this this exercise, you will implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression.
	
	\item You will first start on an example 2D dataset that will help you gain an intuition of
	how the K-means algorithm works. After that, you wil use the K-means algorithm for image
	compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.
	
	\item You will be using ex7.m for this part of the exercise.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementing K-means}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data examples together.
	
	\item The intuition behind K-means is an iterative procedure that starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then refines this guess by repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids and then recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.
	
	\item The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Assigning each training example to its closest centroid 
		\item[(ii)] Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item The K-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids.
	Note that the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids. 
	
	\item Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations. 
	
	\item One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion).
	
	\item Random initialization
	The initial assignments of centroids for the example dataset in \texttt{ex7.m} were designed so that you will see the same gure as in Figure 1. 
	
	\item In practice, a good strategy for initializing the centroids is to select random examples from the training set.
\end{itemize}
%=================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 1. }
For which of the following tasks might K-means clustering be a suitable algorithm? Select all that apply.


%=================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 2.} 
Suppose we have three cluster centroids $\mu_1$=$[1 2]^T$, $\mu_2$=$[−3 0]^T$ and $\mu_3$=$[4 2]^T$. 
Furthermore, we have a training example x(i)=$[3 1]^T$. After a cluster assignment step, what will $c^{(i)}$ be?

K-means is an iterative algorithm, and two of the following steps are repeatedly carried out in its inner-loop. Which two?

Suppose you have an unlabeled dataset $\{x(1),\ldots,x(m)\}$. You run K-means with 50 different random
initializations, and obtain 50 different clusterings of the data.

\section{ML Week 8 : Machine Learning Clustering}

Suppose you have an unlabelled set of observations$\{ x^{(1)},x^{(2)},x^{(3)},x^{(4)}, \ldots ,x^{(n)}\}$.
You run $k-$means with 50 random initializations and obtain 50 different clusterings solution of the data.
What is the recommended way of choosing which solution to use.

\subsection{The Distortion Function}
For each of the clustering solutions, the distortion function is computed as 
\[ \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m}_{i=1} \parallel x^{(i)} - \mu_c^{(i)}\parallel ^2 \]
The optimal clustering solution is the solution that minizes the distortion function.
Since a lower value for a distortion function, implies a better clustering, you should choose the clustering with 
smallest value of the distortion function.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Finding Closest Centroids}

In the cluste assignment phase of the algorithm, the algorithm assigns every training example $x^{(n)}$ to the closest 
centroid, given the current position of the centroids.

\[ C^{(i)} := J \mbox{ that minimizes } \| x^{} - \mu_j \| ^2 \]

\begin{itemize}
	\item $C^{(i)}$ index of the centroid clostest to $x^{(i)}$
	\item $\mu_j$ is the position of the $j-$th centroid.
\end{itemize}

%---------------%
\subsection{Computing Centroid Means}

\[ 
\mu_k := \frac{1}{abs(C_k)} \sum_{i \in C_k} x^{(i)}
\]
%---------------%

A good way to initialize k-mean is to select $k$ distinct examples from the training set and set the cluster centroids equal to these selected examples.

On every iteration of $k-$means, the cost function $J(C^{(1)},C^{(2)},\ldots, C^{(n)},
\mu_1,\ldots \mu_k)$

The distortion function should either stay the same or decrease, in particular it should not increase.

%---------------%
\subsection{Recommended Applications of PCA}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data Compression: reducing the dimensionof input data $x^{(i)}$, which will be used in a supervised learning algorithm
	(i.e. use PCA data so that your supervised learning algorithm runs faster.
	
	\item Data Visualization: Reduce data to 2D ( or 3D) so that it can be plotted.
\end{itemize}

\section{Principal Component Analysis}


\subsection{ Question 1. }

Consider the following 2D dataset:


Which of the following figures correspond to possible values that PCA may return for u(1) (the first eigenvector / first principal component)? 
Check all that apply (you may have to check more than one figure).

(Select both parallel vectors - CORRECT)







%====================================================================%

\subsection{ Question 2. }
Which of the following is a reasonable way to select the number of principal components k?

(Recall that n is the dimensionality of the input data and m is the number of input examples.)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Choose the value of k that minimizes the approximation error 1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||2.
	
	\item Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 1\% of the variance is retained.
	
	\item Choose k to be 99\% of n (i.e., k=0.99∗n, rounded to the nearest integer).
	
	\item Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 99% of the variance is retained. [CORRECT - Selected]
	
\end{itemize}
%====================================================================%
\subsection{ Question 3. }
Suppose someone tells you that they ran PCA in such a way that "95\% of the variance was retained." What is an equivalent statement to this?

1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||21m∑mi=1||x(i)||2≥0.95 [INCORRECT Selected]

1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||21m∑mi=1||x(i)||2≤0.05

1m∑mi=1||x(i)||21m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||2≥0.95

1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||21m∑mi=1||x(i)||2≥0.05

%====================================================================%
\subsection{ Question 4. }
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Given an input x $in$ $\mathbb{R}^n$, PCA compresses it to a lower-dimensional vector z$in$ $\mathbb{R}^k$.
	
	\item PCA can be used only to reduce the dimensionality of data by 1 (such as 3D to 2D, or 2D to 1D).
	
	\item If the input features are on very different scales, it is a good idea to perform feature scaling before applying PCA.
	
	\item Feature scaling is not useful for PCA, since the eigenvector calculation (such as using Octave's svd(Sigma) routine) takes care of this automatically.
\end{itemize}
%====================================================================%
\subsection{ Question 5. }
Which of the following are recommended applications of PCA? Select all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [CORRECT] Data compression: Reduce the dimension of your data, so that it takes up less memory / disk space.
	
	\item [CORRECT] Data compression: Reduce the dimension of your input data x(i), which will be used in a supervised learning algorithm (i.e., use PCA so that your supervised learning algorithm runs faster).
	
	\item As a replacement for (or alternative to) linear regression: For most learning applications, PCA and linear regression give substantially similar results.
	
	\item Data visualization: To take 2D data, and find a different way of plotting it in 2D (using k=2).
	
\end{itemize}
%====================================================================%

\section{Anomaly Detection}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 1. }
For which of the following problems would \textbf{anomaly detection} be a suitable algorithm?

\begin{itemize}
	\item From a large set of hospital patient records, predict which patients have a particular disease (say, the flu).
	\item From a large set of primary care patient records, identify individuals who might have unusual health conditions.
	\item CORRECT
	Given data from credit card transactions, classify each transaction according to type of purchase (for example: food, transportation, clothing).
	\item 
	In a computer chip fabrication plant, identify microchips that might be defective.
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 2. Variant A}
Suppose you have trained an anomaly detection system that flags anomalies when p(x) is less than $\epsilon$, and you find on the cross-validation set that it has 
too many false negatives (failing to flag a lot of anomalies). What should you do?


\begin{itemize}
	\item Increase $\epsilon$ [CORRECT]
	\item Decrease $\epsilon$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 2. Variant B}
Suppose you have trained an anomaly detection system for fraud detection, and your system that flags anomalies when p(x) is less than ε, and you find on the 
cross-validation set that it mis-flagging far too many good transactions as fradulent. What should you do?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Increase $\epsilon$ 
	\item Decrease $\epsilon$ [CORRECT]
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 3. }
Suppose you are developing an anomaly detection system to catch manufacturing defects in airplane engines. You model uses

\[p(x)=∏nj=1p(xj;\muj,\sigma^2_j).\]

You have two features $x_1$ = vibration intensity, and $x_2$ = heat generated. 

Both x1 and x2 take on values between 0 and 1 (and are strictly greater than 0), and for most "normal" engines you expect that $x_1 \approx x_2$. 

One of the suspected anomalies is that a flawed engine may vibrate very intensely even without generating much heat (large x1, small x2), even though the particular values of x1 and x2 may not fall outside their typical ranges of values. What additional feature x3 should you create to capture these types of anomalies:

\begin{itemize}
	\item x3=x1/x2 [CORRECT]
	
	\item x3=x21×x2
	
	\item x3=x1×x2
	
	\item  x3=x1+x2
	
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 4. }
Which of the following are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
	\item When evaluating an anomaly detection algorithm on the cross validation set (containing some positive and some negative examples), classification accuracy is usually a good evaluation metric to use.
	\item  In anomaly detection, we fit a model p(x) to a set of negative (y=0) examples, without using any positive examples we may have collected of previously observed anomalies.
	\item \textbf{CORRECT} When developing an anomaly detection system, it is often useful to select an appropriate numerical performance metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm.
	\item In a typical anomaly detection setting, we have a large number of anomalous examples, and a relatively small number of normal/non-anomalous examples.
\end{itemize}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 5. }
You have a 1-D dataset $\{x(1),\ldots,x(m)\}$ and you want to detect outliers in the dataset. You first plot the dataset and it looks like this:


Suppose you fit the gaussian distribution parameters μ1 and σ21 to this dataset. Which of the following values for μ1 and σ21 might you get?
\begin{itemize}
	\item μ1=−3,σ21=4
	\item 
	μ1=−6,σ21=4
	\item
	μ1=−3,σ21=2
	\item 
	μ1=−6,σ21=2
\end{itemize}
