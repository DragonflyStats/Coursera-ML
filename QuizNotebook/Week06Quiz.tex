%ML Week 6

\section*{High variance}

\begin{itemize}
	\item indicated by gap in errors between training and testing data sets.
	\item Algorithm has overfit the data for the training data set.
	\item Increasing the regularization parameter will reduce overfitting
\end{itemize}
The recommended way to choose a value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose
the lowest cross validation error.
You should not use the training data set for this purpose.

\section{Week 6: Advice for Applying Machine Learning}

\subsection*{Question 1. }
You train a learning algorithm, and find that it has unacceptably high error on the test set. You plot the learning curve, and obtain the figure below. Is the algorithm suffering from high bias, high variance, or neither?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Neither
	
	\item High variance
	
	\item High bias
\end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 2. }
Suppose you have implemented regularized logistic regression  to classify what object is in an image (i.e., to do object recognition). However, when you test your hypothesis on a new set of images, you find that it makes unacceptably large 
errors with its predictions on the new images. However, your

hypothesis performs well (has low error) on the

training set. Which of the following are promising steps to

take? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Try increasing the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
\item 
Try evaluating the hypothesis on a cross validation set rather than the test set.
\item 
Try using a smaller set of features.
\item 
Try decreasing the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
\end{itemize}
%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 3. }
Suppose you have implemented regularized logistic regression

to predict what items customers will purchase on a web shopping site. However, when you test your hypothesis on a new

set of customers, you find that it makes unacceptably large errors in its predictions. Furthermore, the hypothesis

performs poorly on the training set. Which of the following might be promising steps to take? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Try decreasing the regularization parameter $\lambda$.

\item[(ii)] Use fewer training examples.

\item[(iii)] Try evaluating the hypothesis on a cross validation set rather than the test set.

\item[(iv)] Try adding polynomial features.
\end{itemize}
%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 4. }
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)]
Suppose you are training a regularized linear regression model. The recommended way to choose what value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose the value of $\lambda$ which gives the lowest test set error.
	\item[(ii)]
Suppose you are training a regularized linear regression model. The recommended way to choose what value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose the value of $\lambda$ which gives the lowest cross validation error.
	\item[(iii)]
The performance of a learning algorithm on the training set will typically be better than its performance on the test set.
	\item[(iv)]
Suppose you are training a regularized linear regression model.The recommended way to choose what value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose the value of $\lambda$ which gives the lowest training set error.
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 5. }
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)]
A model with more parameters is more prone to overfitting and typically has higher variance. SELECTED
	\item[(ii)]
If the training and test errors are about the same, adding more features will not help improve the results. SELECTED
	\item[(iii)]
If a learning algorithm is suffering from high variance, adding more training examples is likely to improve the test error.
	\item[(iv)]
If a learning algorithm is suffering from high bias, only adding more training examples may not improve the test error significantly.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Week 6: Machine Learning System Design}

\subsection*{Question 1} 
You are working on a spam classification system using regularized logistic regression. "Spam" is a positive class (y = 1) and "not spam" is the negative class (y = 0). You have trained your classifier and there are m = 1000 examples in the cross-validation set. The chart of predicted class vs. actual class is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline 
	& Actual Class: 1	& Actual Class: 0 \\ \hline
	Predicted Class: 1 &	85&	890 \\  \hline  
	Predicted Class: 0 &	15&	10\\ \hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}


\begin{framed}
For reference:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Accuracy = (true positives + true negatives) / (total examples)
	\item Precision = (true positives) / (true positives + false positives)
	\item Recall = (true positives) / (true positives + false negatives)
	\item F1 score = (2 $\times$ precision $\times$ recall) / (precision + recall)
\end{itemize}

\end{framed}
What is the classifier's precision (as a value from 0 to 1)?

Enter your answer in the box below. If necessary, provide at least two values after the decimal point.

0.09
%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Question 1} 
CORRECT
Suppose a massive dataset is available for training a learning algorithm. Training on a lot of data is likely to give good performance when two of the following conditions hold true.

Which are the two?

\begin{itemize}
	\item When we are willing to include high
	
	order polynomial features of x (such as x21, x22,
	
	x1x2, etc.).
	
\item	SELECTED The features x contain sufficient
	
	information to predict y accurately. (For example, one
	
	way to verify this is if a human expert on the domain
	
	can confidently predict y when given only x).
	
	
\item 	SELECTED  We train a learning algorithm with a
	
	large number of parameters (that is able to
	
	learn/represent fairly complex functions).
	
	
	
\item 	We train a learning algorithm with a
	
	small number of parameters (that is thus unlikely to
	
	overfit).
\end{itemize}



%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Question 3.}


Suppose you have trained a logistic regression classifier which is outputing $h\theta(x)$.


Currently, you predict 1 if $h\theta(x) \geq $threshold, and predict 
0 if $h\theta(x)$ < threshold, where currently the threshold is set to 0.5.

Suppose you decrease the threshold to 0.1. Which of the following are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, but
	
	lower accuracy.
	
\item 	The classifier is likely to now have higher precision.
	
\item 	SELECTED The classifier is likely to now have higher recall.
	
\item	The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, but higher accuracy.
	
	%----------------------%
	
\item 	The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, and thus the same F1 score.
	
\item 	The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, but	higher accuracy.
	
	
\item 	SELECTED The classifier is likely to now have lower precision.
	
\item	The classifier is likely to now have lower recall.
\end{itemize}

%---------------------------------------------------------%
%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 4.} WRONG
Suppose you are working on a spam classifier, where spam

emails are positive examples (y=1) and non-spam emails are

negative examples (y=0). You have a training set of emails

in which 99% of the emails are non-spam and the other 1% is

spam. Which of the following statements are true? Check all

that apply.


WRONG If you always predict spam (output y=1),

your classifier will have a recall of 0% and precision

of 99%.


WRONG If you always predict non-spam (output

y=0), your classifier will have a recall of

0%.


CORRECT If you always predict spam (output y=1),

your classifier will have a recall of 100% and precision

of 1%.



CORRECT If you always predict non-spam (output

y=0), your classifier will have an accuracy of

99%.

%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 5.}

Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item CORRECT Using a very large training set makes it unlikely for model to overfit the training data.
	
	
\item 	WRONG If your model is underfitting the training set, then obtaining more data is likely to help.
	
\item 	CORRECT The "error analysis" process of manually examining the examples which your algorithm got wrong	can help suggest what are good steps to take (e.g., developing new features) to improve your algorithm's performance.
	
	
	
\item	WRONG It is a good idea to spend a lot of time collecting a large amount of data before building your first version of a learning algorithm.
	
	
	
\item WRONG After training a logistic regression classifier, you must use 0.5 as your threshold for predicting whether an example is positive or	negative.
